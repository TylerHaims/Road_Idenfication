# Road_Idenfication
In this repository, we attempt to process satellite images of road networks and use the SegFormer semantic segmentation model to classify pixels as either belonging to the class of road, or not road to create a mask of where the roads in the image are. 

Included in this file is a small subset of the images that were used for training. To access all of the images, navigate to the following Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balraj98/deepglobe-road-extraction-dataset
